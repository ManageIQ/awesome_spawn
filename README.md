AwesomeSpawn is a module that provides some useful features over Ruby's Kernel.spawn.

Some additional features include...

- Parameter passing as a Hash or associative Array sanitizing them to prevent command line injection.
- Ability to pass the contents of stdin as a String.
- Results returned as an object giving access to the output stream, error stream, and exit status.
- Optionally raising an exception when exit status is not 0.
